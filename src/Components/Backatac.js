              <p>"Tearing out my emptiness by tricking <br />
Faking all my dreams, pretend I'm home, Many lies I've build around my feelings, Convincing to believe it in myself <br /> 
Rectify my innocence, its killing, Change my way of living and my goals, I'm ready now and free to other feelings <br />
The leaf now turns to greenâ€¦"</p>
